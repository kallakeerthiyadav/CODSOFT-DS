# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Task
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.
## Dataset
Titanic Dataset containing passenger details such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Fare
## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Cleaned missing values
3. Converted categorical data into numerical form
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated model accuracy
## Result
The model successfully predicts passenger survival with good accuracy.
