## Projects Completed
### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
 Built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
 Used passenger features such as class, gender, age, and fare.
 Applied Logistic Regression for classification.
 Evaluated the model using accuracy score.
### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
 Developed a regression model to predict movie ratings.
 Used features like number of votes and runtime.
 Applied Linear Regression.
 Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
### Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
 Classified Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
 Used the built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
 Applied Logistic Regression for classification.
 Achieved high accuracy due to clean and well-structured data.
