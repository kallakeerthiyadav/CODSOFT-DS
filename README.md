# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on given features.
## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked port
## Target variable:
- Survived
## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
## Model Used
- Logistic Regression
## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Handled missing values
3. Converted categorical data into numerical form
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Trained the machine learning model
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy score
## Result
- Model Accuracy: ~79%
